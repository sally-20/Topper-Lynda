The format of writing each MySQL clause (no code, just syntax structure):

SELECT – Used to specify the columns to retrieve.

FROM – Specifies the table(s) to retrieve data from.

WHERE – Filters rows based on a condition.

JOIN – Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

GROUP BY – Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.

HAVING – Filters groups created by GROUP BY based on aggregate conditions.

ORDER BY – Sorts the result set by one or more columns.

LIMIT – Restricts the number of rows returned.

OFFSET – Skips a specified number of rows before starting to return rows.

DISTINCT – Eliminates duplicate rows from the result.

CASE – Implements conditional logic in queries.

UNION / UNION ALL – Combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements.

IN / NOT IN – Checks whether a value exists in a list or subquery.

BETWEEN – Filters values within a given range.

LIKE – Filters based on pattern matching.

IS NULL / IS NOT NULL – Tests for null or non-null values.

EXISTS / NOT EXISTS – Tests for the existence of rows in a subquery.

RANK() OVER() – Assigns a rank to each row within a partition.

PARTITION BY – Divides the result set into partitions for ranking/window functions.

WITH (CTE) – Defines a common table expression used within a query.



The logical order of execution of SQL clauses in MySQL:

FROM – Identify source tables.

JOIN – Perform joins and form intermediate row sets.

WHERE – Filter rows before grouping.

GROUP BY – Group the filtered rows.

HAVING – Filter the grouped data.

SELECT – Pick and compute columns to display.

DISTINCT – Remove duplicate rows from the selected output.

WINDOW FUNCTIONS (e.g., RANK() OVER()) – Apply window functions to result rows.

ORDER BY – Sort the final result set.

LIMIT / OFFSET – Return only a portion of the final result.

This order is different from the writing order but reflects how MySQL internally processes a query.
